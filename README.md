# TOC and thumbnails in ipython

## Short description
    1. The scripts make two gray boxes at the sides of the page
    2. As you hover over them, the corresponding menu is shown
    3. At the left, the TOC, at the right, the thumbnails
    4. Both lists are reloaded every 30s
    5. Have fun

## Examples

* The menu boxes are always  below the active cell.
